          People who have less experience in gardening often find out that something is wrong with their plants only after they die. This is because most of the information about plants are invisible.<br/><br/>To find out the reasons for unsuccessful plant growing experience, our team conducted interviews with novice gardeners to share their difficulties in maintaining healthy plants. From the interviews, we found two main causes of failure: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>forgetfulness</i> and <i>lack of knowledge</i>.<br/><br/></p>

          <p class="body">From the findings from our research, we identified the core information a novice gardener might need. The information included the basic needs of the plants - such as <i>amount of sunlight, water, and fertilizer</i>. We also saw an opportunity for the system to become an interesting <i>educational tool for the gardeners</i>. It could visualize the plants' growth (temporal aspect) as well as provide a microscopic view into them.<br/><br/></p>

          <p class="body">When the plant needs water or sunlight a simple animated alarm appears. This reminds the person to water the plant or put it in a sunny spot. When the water or sunlight is received enough, the raindrops/sunlight reduce and a further confirmation is when the animated avatar (a personification of the plant) turns into a happy face. Our intention was to keep this alarm as non-intrusive as possible, rather than a constant cry for help or admonishment that disrupt the surroundings.<br/></p>

          <p class="body">There is a graphical indication when something is wrong but the detailed information is displayed only when there is a direct invocation. This too responds to physical actions taken by the person and read by the data collector.<br/></p>

          <p class="body">The main design goal of <i>Leafy</i> was to present information to users in easy-to-understand visualizations at the right moment. <br/><br/>We decided that the best way to do so would be to have the interface in the <i>same spatial-context</i> as the plant (hologram) to provide a seamless and immersive interaction between the plant and the user. We also used <i>metaphors</i> and <i>personification</i> to convey the plant as a living organism (a pet) with emotions to help the users become more empathetic.<br/><br/></p>

        <p class="body">Presenting the right information at the right moment is important - but we <i>did not want the experience to be obstructive</i>. So only the most urgent needs of plants are visualized when the user is in proximity, the other information are invoked only when the user speaks to the plant.<br/><br/></p>
