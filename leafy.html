        <h1>Leafy: Holographic Guide for First Time Gardeners<br/></h1>
        <article>
          <p class="body"><br/>People who have less experience in gardening express difficulty growing plants successfully.  They often find out that something is wrong with their plants only after they die. This is because most of the information about plants are innate. <i><br/><br/>Leafy</i>  is a service that  expresses plants' needs to their carers using augmented reality. It helps first time gardeners be more empathetic towards their environment  by gently informing them what they need to do to take care of their plants better.<br/><br/></p>

          <p class="body">Our team conducted interviews with novice gardeners to share their difficulties in  maintaining healthy plants. The  gardeners identified their main causes of failure to be -  <i>forgetfulness</i>  and  <i>lack of knowledge</i>.  One of the commonly shared experience was either forgetting to water the plants or over-watering the plants.<br/><br/></p>

          <p class="body">From the findings from our research, we identified the core information a novice gardener might need. The information included the basic needs of the plants - such as <i>amount of sunlight, water, and fertilizer</i>.<br/><br/>We also saw an opportunity for the system to become an interesting <i>educational tool for the gardeners</i>. It could visualize the plants' growth (temporal aspect) as well as provide a microscopic view into them.<br/><br/></p>

          <p class="body">The main design goal of <i>Leafy</i> was to present information to users in easy-to-understand visualizations at the right moment. <br/><br/>We decided that the best way to do so would be to have the interface in the <i>same spatial-context</i> as the plant (hologram) to provide a seamless and immersive interaction between the plant and the user. <br/><br/>We also used <i>metaphors</i> and <i>personification</i> to convey the plant as a living organism (a pet) with emotions to help the users become more empathetic.<br/></p>

        <p class="body">Presenting the right information at the right moment is important - but we <i>did not want the experience to be obstructive</i>. So only the most urgent needs of plants are visualized when the user is in proximity, the other information are invoked only when the user talks to the plant.<br/><br/></p>

To achieve the effect, we designed and built a hologram simulator with a pane of mirror and acrylic sheets that would float a projection of the mobile device screen in midair.<br/></p>
